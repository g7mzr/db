## Introduction

**This documentation is currently under development.**

DB-PHP is a composer module for php 7.2 and above for accessing Psotgresql Databases
using php.  It started out as part of the "webtemplate" application but developed into
a stand alone module.

## Overview

The full functionality of DB-PHP is accessed using dbmanager.php.  This allows access
to the three modules independently of each other.  The three modules are:
* Admin - Used to manage RBMS users and blank databases
* Schema - Used to create and modify the database schema
* DataAccess - Used to Select, Insert, Delete and Update information in the database.
